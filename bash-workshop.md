# Introduction to the command line

This one-hour workshop introduces the basics of interacting with a computer
using Bash (the Bourne Again Shell). You may have heard the terms "command
line", "terminal", "console", "shell", "interactive prompt", "git-bash", etc.
These all refer to using the keyboard to control your computer by typing
commands.

The material for this workshop is based on a
[UofT Coders lesson](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/misc/bash-intro/lesson/)
and the
[Software Carpentry Unix Shell lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).


**Preparation**: To follow along with this workshop on your own computer, you
will need to have `bash` installed. For Linux and Mac users, `bash` is included
as part of the operating system. In OSX, it can be accessed with `terminal`.

For Windows users, I recommend `git bash`, which is packaged with
[git](https://git-scm.com/) (a common version control system). Follow the
instructions [here](http://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git)
to install git bash. Another option
is [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). As of August 2016, the Windows Subsystem
for Linux (WSL) provides access to most command line tools provided by Ubuntu.
See [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) for
instructions to enable/install the WSL.

## Workshop goals

After this workshop, you will have learned:

- what Bash is and when and why to use it
- how to navigate your computer from the command line using commands like
`pwd`, `cd`, and `ls`
- how to work with files from the command line using commands like `cat`, `cp`,
`mv`, `mkdir`, and `rm`
- handy commands for working with files like `wc`, `head`, `tail`, `history`,
`sort`, and `uniq`
- using "pipes" to combine commands and `>` to redirect output
- where to get more information and help
- time permitting: `cut`

## Why use the command line?

At a high level, computers do four things:

- run programs
- store data
- communicate with each other, and
- interact with us

Computers can interact with us in many different ways, such as through a
keyboard and mouse, touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition
systems. While touch and voice interfaces are becoming more commonplace, most
interaction is still done using traditional screens, mice, touchpads and
keyboards.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is the most widely used way to interact with
personal computers. We give instructions (to run a program, to copy a file, to
create a new folder/directory) with the convenience of a few mouse clicks.
This way of interacting with a computer is intuitive and easy to learn, but it
can become slow and frustrating if we want to repeat similar actions many times.
For example, if we want to copy the third line of each of a thousand text files
and paste them into a single file, using the traditional GUI approach of clicks
will take several hours to do this.

This is where we take advange of the shell - a command-line interface to make
such repetitive tasks automatic and fast. It can take a single instruction and
repeat it as is or with some modification as many times as we want.

Typing instructions to the computer might at first seem counterintuitive and
unnecessarily difficult, but there are several advantages to learning how to
do this.

### Advantages of text-based communication with your computer

- **Repetitive tasks can be automated**
Like in the example above, text-based commands will make it easy for us to
repeat the same process many times.

- **Familiar tasks can be done very quickly**
Think about learning a language: in the beginning it's nice to look things up
in a dictionary (or a menu in a graphical program), and slowly string together
sentences one word at a time. But once we become more proficient in the language
and know what we want to say, it is easier to say or type it directly, instead
of having to look up every word in the dictionary first.

- **Text-based interfaces are less resource-intensive and faster to develop than
GUIs, which means some programs you might want to use don't have a GUI at all**
Graphical components of programs require more resources from your computer to
be run, and they also take more work to create in the first place. Many powerful
programs are written without a graphical user interface (which makes it faster
to create these programs) and to use these programs you often need to know how
to use a text interface. For example, many of the best data analysis and machine
learning packages are written in Python or R, and you need to know a bit about
these languages to use them. Even if the program or package you want to use is
in a different language, much of the knowledge you gain from understanding one
programming language (like Bash) can be transferred to others. In addition, most
powerful computers that you can log into remotely might only give you a text
interface to navigate the computer with.

- **A record of text commands facilitates reproducibility**
It is much easier to automate and reproduce / repeat any task once you have all
the instructions written down. Compare being shown how to perform a certain
analysis in spreadsheet software, where the instructions will be "first you
click here, then here, then here...", with being handed the same workflow
written down in several lines of codes which you can analyse and understand at
your own pace.

## The shell

The Shell is a program which runs other programs rather than doing calculations
itself. Those programs can be as complicated as climate modeling software and
as simple as a program that creates a new directory. The simple programs which
are used to perform stand alone tasks are usually refered to as *commands*. The
most popular Unix shell is Bash, (the Bourne Again SHell â€” so-called because
itâ€™s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a prompt, indicating that
the shell is waiting for input. It might have some text about your computer and
your user identity, and it probably ends with a `$` symbol. Sometimes bash
commands are written down as `$ ls` (for example): you don't have to type the
`$`, only the command itself (`ls`).

```{Bash}
$
```

Let's try a command: `ls` *lists* the contents of the current directory.

```{Bash}
ls
```

If you type a command that Bash doesn't recognize, you'll get an error message:
`ks: command not found`.

```{Bash}
ks
```

## Navigating files and directories

Stuff on your computer is organized into files and folders (also called
directories). You might be used to navigating through your filesystem using a
navigator application and clicking on directory icons, and we can do the same
thing from the command line.

First, the command `pwd` (*print working directory*) tells us where we are in
the filesystem.

```{Bash}
pwd
```

The output you see will likely be different depending on your operating system.
We're all likely in our *home* directory, where terminal or Git Bash opens by
default.

`ls` lists the files and directories inside the current directory. We can add
*flags* or *options* to commands to modify their behaviour: try adding `-F` and
see if you notice what changes about the output.

```{Bash}
ls -F
```

In general, a Bash command begins with the command name (`ls`), is followed by a
list of options that begin with `-` or `--` (`-F`), and ends with arguments. We
can add an argument to `ls` that specifies which directory we want `ls` to look
in. Try the following commands and see what they do.

```{Bash}
ls -a
ls Downloads
ls -F Downloads
ls -F -a /
ls -Fa /
```

`ls` has many options - we've just seen two. To get more information about a
command, you can use the option `--help`, which will print out the manual page
for the command.

```{Bash}
ls --help
```

Another way to access the manual page is with `man`, which stands for *manual*:

```{Bash}
man ls
```

It's possible that only one of these two will work depending on your environment.

> **Challenge**
>
> What does `ls` do when used with
> the `-l` option? What about if you use both the `-l` and the `-h` option?

`pwd` and `ls` tell us about where we are and what's there, but we can also
move around through our filesystem. The command `cd` (*change directory*) is
how to do this.

```{Bash}
cd Downloads
pwd
ls
```

What if we want to go back up one level? We might try using the name of the
higher directory:

```{Bash}
cd madeleine # or whatever your home directory is called
```

But this gives an error: `bash: cd: madeleine: No such file or directory`.

*Path names* are relative: commands like `cd` and `ls` try to relate file and
directory names to ones that can be seen from the current location. We have a
few options to go up one level:

1. Specify the full path

```{Bash}
cd /home/madeleine
pwd
```

2. Use the shortcut `..` to go up one level

`..` is shorthand notation for "the directory that contains the current
directory."

```{Bash}
cd Downloads
cd ..
pwd
```

3. Use the shortcut `-` to go back to the previous directory

`-` is shorthand for "the directory we were in last," which in this case also
happens to be the directory above us.

```{Bash}
cd Downloads
cd -
pwd
```
4. Use the shortcut `~` to go to the home directory

'~' is shorthand for the *home directory*, which in this case is where we want
to go.

```{Bash}
cd Downloads
cd ~
pwd
```

All of these options have the same result in our case where we want to go from
a directory below the home directory back to home. But if we were somewhere else,
they wouldn't necessarily be equivalent.

> **Challenge**
>
> Starting from `/Users/amanda/Desktop/data`, which of the following commands could
> Amanda use to navigate to her home directory, which is `/Users/amanda`?
> Hint: play around with these choices on your own computer by creating and
> navigating to a folder called `data` on your desktop using the following commands:
> `cd Desktop`
> `mkdir data`
> `cd data`
> Remember that `cd -` will take you back to the previous directory after each

>
> 1. cd .
> 2. cd /
> 3. cd /home/amanda
> 4. cd ../..
> 5. cd ~
> 6. cd home
> 7. cd ~/Desktop/data/../..
> 8. cd
> 9. cd ..

**Handy tip: tab completion**

Whenever you're typing in your terminal, you can hit `Tab` to auto-complete a
command, filename, or directory name. If there's only one possibility, it will
auto-complete; if there are more than one, hitting `Tab` a second time will show
all the possibilities.

```{Bash}
cd Des # and hit "Tab"
```

## Working with files

We've seen how to navigate our computer using commands, and now it's time to
actually make some changes.
